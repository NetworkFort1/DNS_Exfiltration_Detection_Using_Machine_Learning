# DNS Exfiltration Detection Using Machine Learning

**Overview:**
This repository presents a solution for the detection of DNS exfiltration attempts using machine learning techniques. DNS exfiltration is a technique employed by malicious actors to transfer data outside a network by encoding it within DNS requests. This project focuses on implementing machine learning models to analyze network traffic patterns and identify anomalous DNS activities indicative of exfiltration attempts.

**Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** The repository includes comprehensive data preprocessing scripts to prepare network traffic data for machine learning analysis, ensuring that the data is appropriately formatted and cleaned.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning models, such as decision trees, random forests, and deep learning models, are implemented for the purpose of detecting DNS exfiltration patterns in network traffic. Model selection is based on performance metrics and adaptability to the nature of DNS exfiltration.
- **Evaluation and Metrics:** The project provides evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the implemented models. Precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics are utilized to quantify the efficacy of the models in accurately detecting DNS exfiltration attempts.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation is available to guide users through the setup, usage, and customization of the machine learning models. It includes explanations of the features used, model parameters, and best practices for improving detection accuracy.

**Getting Started:**
To get started with DNS exfiltration detection using machine learning, follow the instructions in the provided documentation. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed, and the dataset is appropriately configured before running the scripts.
